What happened was simple. On the morning of October 24th (2019) at 6 AM , all Kindred woke to find themselves mortal. This lasted until the night of the 31st when they weren't able to fall asleep until daysleep took them the morning of the 1st, waking up dead once more that evening.

The Camarilla and Anarchs have adopted the term 'The Reversion' while the Sabbat chose to refer to it as 'The Regression.' This is how Road of Mercy will be referenced In-Character unless the PC has a different name for it.

These were the mechanical changes to characters that took place for this week:

* All characters (Kindred and Ghouls) no longer had access to the following: disciplines, blood expenditure, frenzy, and anything that is innately inhuman was removed.
* All characters were 100% human. This means that they needed to breathe, eat, and so on. But, this also means that they were able to enjoy all of the pleasures of human life: sex, drugs, sunlight, etc. This also means that their appearance could've changed during this time, such if they were to dye their hair or get a tattoo.
* Humanity scores for everyone had been set to 7. This includes pathed individuals who were returned to Humanity for the duration.
* Blood bonds dissipated, though did return once the week ended.
* Clan weaknesses were null. Toreador were not entranced by art, the Nosferatu regained the appearance score of when they were mortal, and so on.
* Any wounds ailing them as Kindred disappeared as if they never existed. Wounds or illnesses sustained before their embrace, such as a missing limb or a dormant disease, would continue to impact them as a human being.
* All ghouls and Kindred find themselves as the age they were upon embrace. They continued to age normally from that point forward as if nothing had stopped them.
* All discipline or blood magic effects ended. If a Gangel had used Earth Meld, they woke up on the ground where they had melded, and if a Setite removed their heart, they didn't wake at all.

* Death was possible. If someone died during this event, they were spawned as a rather atypical Wraith in the Shadowlands. Once the week ended, they were returned to their corpse (as long as they didn't stray too far from it and their body was still in-tact) with two distinct changes: the Half-Life merit's aura (being a wraith in human form without the skill in necromancy and ability to enter the Shadowlands at will), and some type of flaw caused by their death. Flaws that have been chosen before were a low level Arcane Curse, permanent wound, and Shadow Walker. This flaw would have faded over the course of the next decade.
* Pathed Characters likely degenerated a couple of dots as their time human changed their perspective and weakened their resolve in such an alien morality. Some even found themselves on Humanity once more after the week ended. Regardless of age, any characters made now will not be able to have a path rating above 5.

It goes without question that political upheaval was afoot, especially if influential figures faced their Final Death during this week. The Camarilla and Sabbat were most impacted by this with propaganda being shaken to its core, or perhaps incredibly reinforced. But, it wasn't this week alone that tore at the established foundations of Kindred society, rather another unforeseen consequence.

Dhampirs.

In other words, if female Kindred neglected to use protection during this week, and their bodies could still sustain a fetus (IE their uterus wasn't missing for some reason), they'd find themselves pregnant not long after Halloween. The process appeared to be accelerated by their vitae which allowed the news to spread rather quickly throughout Kindred society.

The most predicable reaction was that of the Sabbat. Their strongholds within Canada and Mexico became even more dangerous to exist in as the massacres took place. They wished to destroy any possible sign of the end times as fast as possible, or so most of them claim.

With how scattered the Anarch Movement was, responses were based on an individual Baron basis. At least within the Barony of Angels, Baron Baldwin was more than willing to state he wasn't interested in any drastic action.

And finally, the Camarilla. Many of its members held out, naively assuming they were going to have a change of heart to retain as much fealty as possible. That, of course, wasn't the case. The Inner Circle sent out Archons to princes all over, ordering them to surrender any expecting Kindred to the Tremere with those resisting facing execution.

More than a few Kindred were off-put by the reaction of their sect, or perhaps their own beliefs became too hard to deny any longer. Mass defection to the Anarchs and the Sabbat began, leaving the Camarilla at its all time weakest since the Convention of Thorns.

The Dhampirs were the spark on tensions already soaked in gasoline. During the last decade, the majority of them were killed due to Sabbat sieges, Camarilla raids, experimentation, hunters, untimely frenzies, poor health, or just shit luck. Because of this, they more or less have faded into the background, though that doesn't mean those concerned with their existence (such as the majority of the Sword) won't take the time to drop a body here or there should one be sniffed out.

There's no restrictions on whether or not your character ended up having a child as a result of this week, though it's advised to speak with a Storyteller on how to go about explaining why they've lasted this long.
