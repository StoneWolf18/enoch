Disciplines are one of the most beneficial gifts the Embrace has to offer. Unlike immortality, their uses are almost instantly perceivable, with even the youngest of fledglings given abilities to overpower most mortals. With time, Kindred are able to hone these powers into producing nearly unimaginable supernatural feats.

As with most other Traits, Disciplines all have dot ratings. A single dot implies that the character has only just started exploring a Discipline, but has barely scratched the surface. However ratings of six dots or more shows true mastery of the Discipline, with such comprehension beyond the ability of most neonates and ancillae. Discipline dots, like other traits, are also restricted by your character's generation minimum.

<b>Note:</b> Unless stated in the description, Disciplines cost no blood or Willpower points to activate.

<div class="leftHeader">Advancing Disciplines</div>
All Kindred start character creation with three dots they can distribute in any way they like to Disciplines innate to their clan. Catiff, however, must take at least one discipline from their sire's clan (or one they new, should they also be Clanless). The other two can be taken from any of the physical (Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence) or common (Animalism, Auspex, Dominate, Presence, and Obfuscate) Disciplines.

* All characters can lean the physical disciplines (Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence) independent of a teacher as long as they devote the time and experience required.
* Common out-of-clan disciplines (Animalism, Auspex, Dominate, Presence, and Obfuscate) must be taught by a teacher after giving the student one point of blood, along with the required experience expenditure. The student may only learn to the level their teacher currently knows, though that would not stop them from finding someone more practiced.
* Rare/Clan-Specific disciplines (Chimestry, Dementation, Obtenebration, Protean, Quietus, Serpentis, Vicissitude, and Bloodline Specific Disciplines) must gain Storyteller approval before being taught to a character who is not of the clan/bloodline that has the Discipline innately.
* Any type of blood sorcery must be taken at character creation any may not be taught to any other character unless they already have the discipline. (Ex. Tremere can share paths, but can't teach anyone else Thaumaturgy.)
* The Gargoyle "discipline" Flight can only be taught to other Gargoyles.
