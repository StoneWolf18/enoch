  LA in Anarchy is set in 2029 Los Angeles, though with days advancing as close to real time as possible. Because of this, we are both moving away from the metaplot detailed in <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Angeles_by_Night">Los Angeles by Night (1994)</a> and <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_5th_Edition">Vampire: the Masquerade 5th Edition (2018)</a> to create an experience unique to our setting.

  It's important to note that we consider our setting to be in Modern Nights as opposed to Final Nights. Aside from the Week of Nightmares, no other Final Nights events (wars, political changes, etc) are recognized. However, this is from a meta point of view, and characters are able to believe the end-times are upon them if they wish.

  Below is the timeline of events. This is a build up of important happenings since the server's opening in 2018, so please take a moment to read through before making your character.

  <b>Wait, 2029? How Sci-fi is the setting?</b>

  The short answer is: not very.

  More specifically, following the trend of predictions versus actual technological outcomes, we were pretty off the mark. It was assumed we might have colonized Mars by 2020, and all we got were slightly bigger smart phones and semi-autonomous cars in a legal grey area. Apple first released their smart watch in 2015 and it was only mid to late 2020 that the concept really started to take off. While there can be some logical assumptions made about how tech has advanced, the setting is by no means Cyberpunk.

  <b>What about COVID?</b>

  We've chosen to ignore it for the setting. Any biographies should be written as if it hadn't occurred.

  Week of Nightmares
  </div>
  The only canon event we recognize as happening before the start date of our chronicle (08/03/2018) is the <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Week_of_Nightmares">Week of Nightmares</a>. It lasted from Monday, June 28 to Sunday, July 4, 1999 when the assumed Ravnos Antediluvian Zapathasura woke in India. The majority of its effects were covered by the efforts of both the Camarilla and (primarily) the Technocracy, with the only remnants being the impact it had on the Ravnos as a clan. If you aren't sure what this is, and don't plan on playing a Ravnos, then it likely isn't important to dwell on.

  Barony of Angels
  </div>
  At this time, the current Baron of the bulk of the city is a Brujah named Garret Baldwin. He took control in 2010 after his sire decided to retire, leaving the territory up for grabs between him and his brother, Barret Chance. Baron Baldwin was favorable out of the two for his platforms on self control and relaxed leadership, whereas the now Reeve Chance was much more radicalized, wishing to expel anyone and anyone not loyal to him out of LA and risk both internal conflict between gangs, and an external war.

  Vampire Murders
  </div>
  A vampire-themed convention was in LA from August 13th to August 15th, 2018. The conclusion of the event on the 15th was an in-universe LARP which mortals had organized. Kindred in attendance were soon faced with various fledglings in their first hungry frenzy, as a Sabbat shovel party was set off not long after the event had begun. When the shovelheads had been taken care of, the Ductus that had organized the attack monolouged before the Kindred finally escaped, human police rushing to the scene.

  Of the humans that had survived the massacre, all types of media from the slaughter made its way onto various social media platforms. The Masquerade was pulled taught for the next few months as many tried to capitalize on what was assumed by Kine as a terrorist attack (even though an organization never claimed responsibility.)

  Murders began to spike all around Los Angeles with corpses victim of exsanguination being found as well as piles of ash and individuals with stakes embedded into their chests. Kindred deduced this to be the work of both irresponsible Kindred, mortals trying to copy-cat, and both amateur and experienced hunters.

  <div class="secondHeader">
  Wildlife Assurance Agency
  </div>
  Not long after the murders had begun to die down did something else catch the attention of local Kindred. Quite a few of them were going missing, either to reappear days later or disappear entirely. After some time, it was pieced together that some type of organization was kidnapping Kindred for scientific study: a government agency known as the WAA, or Wildlife Assurance Agency.

  There isn't much known about them at this time, aside from the organization's head being a man by the name of Winthrop Abram Luigi (commonly referred to as W. A. Luigi.) Their methods for taking Kindred normally include the use of large windowless vans with paramilitary squadrons containing their "subjects" for transport. Experimentation has included interrogation, exposure to various elements and other species, starvation, conscious vivisection, and more all recorded with surveillance cameras.

  There have been a total of 3 raids on their local facilities with the location of a fourth revealed during the most recent.

  <div class="secondHeader">
  A New Prince Reigns
  </div>
  A Ventrue neonate by the name of Jacob Barrett established himself as prince of the merger Camarilla presence within the city. He was uncontested until his incompetence came to light with the failed diablerie attempt of an elder. Elder Ventrue Viktoria von Andeches quickly declared praxis with the majority of the local Camarilla supporting her.

  Baron Baldwin was willing to allow her to declare domain over the Tower downtown as long as she was only going to police her own subjects so he didn't have to.

  <div class="secondHeader">
  Epidemic
  </div>
  On 9/22/2019, it was suddenly brought to the attention of the Kindred of LA that there was a strange disease going around that only impacted them. After feeding on an infected mortal, they would begin to feel slow and weak, before finally their bite became painful and they struggled to keep any type of blood that wasn't Kindred Vitae down.

  It didn't take long for the Kindred investigating to realize that a campaign for a new flu vaccine was being pushed for in the city, starting with drives for homeless, before moving onto being more widely available. Soon it was revealed that the WAA was attempting to "cure" the "disease" Kindred were impacted with, even though all it would do is send those it starved into torpor.

  With flu shot season past and a method of treatment developed, no one has succumbed to what was dubbed the Plague in some months. However, that doesn't keep local Kindred from being a bit too careful when hunting.

  <div class="secondHeader">
  The Reversion
  </div>
  All Kindred woke at 6 AM on October 23rd, 2019 as human beings. This lasted until November 1st, everyone finding it impossible to fall asleep that morning until daysleep took them. Details on how this impacted Kindred more specifically can be found on the event's page: <a href="road-of-mercy.md">Road of Mercy</a>.

  The sects responded differently to this, with the Sabbat viewing it as The Regression (regressing from their vampiric state to the lesser one of humanity), with the Anarchs and Camarilla viewing it as The Reversion (reverting to being human.) Many both left and joined their sects because of this, whether they saw it as proof of God's existence and wished to repent, or a sign of the end times.

  That wasn't the only consequence, however. Any female Kindred that didn't die and neglected to use protection when they had sex during this week found themselves pregnant even once they resumed undeath. This brought about a sheer panic to both the Camarilla and Sabbat Kindred, with the Anarchs stuck in the middle of their paranoid squabbling.

  Rought with fears of Gehenna, the Sabbat was quick to execute any and every pregnant cainite they came across. Progroms were held in Canada, Mexico, and parts of Europe to make sure they could stave their impending doom a while longer. The Camarilla, as much as they attempted to disguise it, held similar fears. Claiming it was to "protect the masquerade," they ordered all Princes to retrieve any pregnant Kindred and have them brought to local Tremere chantries "for monitoring." Any who didn't comply were to be executed.

  The Third Anarch Revolt
  </div>
  The fuse was lit. Over the next few nights, utter chaos erupted among Kindred society.

  It began with a mass defection. The Ivory Tower crumbled as the Brujah, Gangrel, Nosferatu, and Toreador withdrew as pillar clans, and many of it's members renounced their allegiance, bolstering both the Sabbat and Movement's numbers by considerable margins. Even the Tremere splintered, with elder Carna removing herself from the sect, and bringing many of the younger Warlocks with her. Previously Camarilla strongholds became zones of attrition between newly declared Anarch gangs and Sabbat Packs trying to scrape together whatever advantage they could, while the Camarilla that remained fled to the what few cities were still theirs. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-PLqo_Lagn2L_rk_CfmrV0f6FLc7D9Tm65Wztv9wBU/edit?usp=sharing"><em>(City Alignment Sheet)</em></a>

  All the while Los Angeles, the renown Anarch Free State, was seeing Kindred arrive in droves. Anarchs wanting to escape the fighting and Antitirbu growing disillusioned with their respective sects alike wished to find some place to gather until the dust settled. Wishing to get ahead of the eventual turf wars, Baron Baldwin withdrew from the greater LA area, concentrating his efforts on securing the Barony of Angels.

  With territory up for grabs, and the local Tremere having already defected with most of the Camarilla in LA, Carna made her intentions to center her house's operations there very clear. The Lord that had been sent to investigate the status of the LA Chantry, Meera Braun, was instructed to begin relocation to Rockhaven Sanitarium and prepare the site for the rest of the now Anarch-aligned clan's arrival.

  Out of the independent clans, the Followers of Set were impacted most heavily. Radicalized, the Cohort of Wepwawet sized control over the majority of the cults. With many Setites now disillusioned from the Reversion, those who didn't share the Warriors' fervor quickly fled to the Movement. Others found themselves among the Serpents of the Light as the Sword's belief in Gehenna swayed them more than the supposed return of Set.

  Current Situation
  </div>
  The Camarilla is a shadow of its former self, with only the Ventrue, Tremere, and Malkavian as officially represented clans. They have tried to appeal to Caitiff, which goes to show how desperate they are for numbers. Openly declaring support with the Camarilla is a sure way to put a target on your back, and a molotov in your haven.

  Successful in many of their sieges, the Sabbat is heavily radicalized and waiting to be pointed at their next target. Despite the belief in their cause, the numbers they gained diluted their ranks. Disorganization and misinformation continue to spread among newer packs, with the gap between True and False growing by the evening.

  In all of this, the Anarchs have never seen so much support. While previously they had been a young mixture brought together by mutual hatred of the Tower and not much else, the defectors from the Camarilla and Sabbat both have brought some semblance of structure. While not all Anarch strongholds are as dedicated as others, the Status Perfectus made more than a few rounds, with Kindred previously having scoffed at the idea now giving it a second thought.

  Locally, downtown Los Angeles remains under the control of Baron Garret Baldwin. He intends to keep the Barony of Angels a neutral ground, allowing Kindred a location to haven and hunt provided they respect his domain.

  Glendale has officially been declared an Anarch Barony by Councilor Carna, although she is rarely seen among the territory herself. Many of the anarch chantry's nightly operations fall to the magisters that defected, and previous Lord Braun that has been assigned as Regent.

  The only other claimed territory is Hollywood, which remains under the control of the Toreador Methuselah Melisande. With a notable lack of interest in the Jyhad, she does little to provoke those that respect her domain.

  Most recently, the Camarilla appointed elder Ventrue Nathaniel Stafford as the new Prince. There are rumors that this has attracted some of the remaining Camarilla members to the city, although few anarchs spreading such things have little but hearsay to prove it.
