      Mature Content

      While it is not a rule, we recommend that all players are 18+ due to mature subject matters such as (but not limited to): sexual violence, political extremism, physical violence and gore, mind control, torture, abuse, imprisonment and kidnapping, racism, sexism, and homophobia.

      Language

      Learning Rituals

      To learn rituals, you must work towards learning it in-character. This process may last several weeks, even months, as determined by a Storyteller. You must spend XP equivalent to 3x the Ritual Level in order to learn it. In order for time to be counted, a post must be made at least once every five days demonstrating the player character is studying and practicing the Ritual. This may only be done one at a time.
