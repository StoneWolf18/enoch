All Bloodlines (any clan/bloodline that isn't of the 12 allowed clans) are restricted. There are special conditions that must be met before a Bloodline character can be considered for approval:

* The player must have at least two characters that are played regularly.
* Five nonrefundable freebies must be spent on the chosen bloodline.

<div class="thirdHeader">I don't like playing more than one character. Can I play a bloodline anyway?</div>

Unfortunately not. While we understand not everyone likes to juggle more than one PC, the character minimum is to ensure two things: that the player is active, and that the Storyteller has a good grasp on how you might handle such a character.

<div class="thirdHeader">Why do I have to spend freebies?</div>

To make it a commitment, much like buying an expensive merit.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Important</b>

Please do your research! If you can't give a viable reason as to why a Harbinger or Kiasyd would be in LA in the Modern Nights, it might be best to consider playing something else.
