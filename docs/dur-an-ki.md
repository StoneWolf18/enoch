Very few Kindred in the modern nights outside of the secretive halls of Clan Tremere, know that the Assassins have a history of practicing blood magic that stretches back to the now mythical nights of the Second City. Among the Tremere that know of these strange arts, their interest is balanced by revulsion and fear. It is almost blasphemous to the Hermetic mindset of the Warlocks that such loosely-structured practices can truly be called “magic.” However potent effects spring from these practices — some which bear a striking resemblance to the Tremere’s precious Thaumaturgy. This strikes fear into their cold, dead hearts that their supposed monopoly of blood magic might be under threat.

<div class="leftHeader">Paths of Dur-An-Ki</div>
Many of the paths associated with DurAn-Ki are functionally identical to various Thaumaturgy paths. In many cases, the Dur-An-Ki version came first and was adapted to Thaumaturgy by Tremere. Those that are playable in LA in Anarchy are:

* The Path of Life’s Waters (Path of Blood, V20, pp. 213-214)
* The Covenant of Enki (Neptune’s Might, V20, pp. 218-220)
* The Laws of Suleiman (Spirit Manipulation, p. 142-145)

In addition to these familiar paths, there are several paths unique to practitioners of DurAn-Ki, though only The Hunter’s Winds is available for play at this time.
