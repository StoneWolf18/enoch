Flight is the fourth pseudo-discipline that all gargoyles start with for free. Unlike other disciplines, Flight is tracked as one mechanically on a character sheet, but doesn't function as one past that. Because of this, it cannot be taught to other characters unless they're also a gargoyle. Dots past 5 add 100 pounds/45 kg of weight and 20 miles/30 kilometers per hour to the speed.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> The character cannot actually fly, but can soar like a hang-glider. He also cannot carry anything (he needs his hands to help steer). Maximum speed is equal to prevailing winds, or 15 miles/25 kilometers per hour in calm air. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> The character can make a running takeoff and carry 20 pounds/10 kilograms while flying. Maximum speed is 30 miles/50 kilometers per hour. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> The character can make a straight, vertical takeoff if unencumbered, or can make a running take-off carrying up to 50 pounds/25 kg. Maximum air speed is 45 miles/70 kilometers per hour. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> The character can now make a vertical takeoff with up to 50 pounds/25 kg of baggage, but can carry up to 100 pounds/45 kg while flying. Maximum speed is 60 miles/95 kilometers per hour. <br>

Maximum speed is 75 miles/120 kilometers per hour.
