<div class="leftHeader">What is a rework?</div>
Feeling out a character takes time, and maybe after a couple months of play you realize that the sheet you made all that time ago doesn't accurately reflect them anymore. That's okay! Everyone is able to rework a character sheet to get it where you want it.

A rework is giving a character a mechanical blank slate, creating a brand new sheet as if they were a new character. Because it's being treated as a brand new sheet, we'll review it for anything that was missed during the original submission. This means adhering to current character creation rules, correcting mechanical problems, backstory discrepancies, and other potential issues that were originally overlooked.

<div class="secondHeader">What can I change with a rework?</div>
Technically, the only thing that can't change is the character's name, though we advise not making changes that would be too big to retcon (such as their clan.)

<div class="secondHeader">Do I keep my XP and earned merits/backgrounds?</div>
Any spent XP is refunded, but other traits (such as merits and backgrounds) earned in-character are subject to approval for transfer. Any XP earned up until the point of the rework submission can be spent with justification through an appended biography.

<div class="secondHeader">How many times can I rework a character?</div>
Every approved character gets <b>one</b> rework.

<div class="secondHeader">How can I submit a rework?</div>
Through Caine as you did the original submission, though inform the Storyteller or an Assistant that it's a rework before submitting.
