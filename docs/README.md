    Roleplay > Roll-play
    </div>
    Rolls happen, as Vampire is a TTRPG, but not constantly or without reason. With a strong focus on narrative over mechanics, we're nearly always looking for the best story opportunity versus the best statistical advantage.

      Creation Options
    </div>
    Players familiar with Vampire can start with characters from 12 different clans, with a maximum age of 500, and 100 potential bonus experience upon creation. Once the requirements are met, one of the many <a href="#bloodlines">bloodlines</a> we have available can be applied for as well.

    Player Agency Protection
    </div>
  No one likes making a character only to have someone kill them after an hour of play. This is why killing, ghouling, or using a discipline on another PC requires consent from their player. Additionally, players can't spend willpower on contested rolls to keep matters fair. Of course, none of these restrictions apply to Storyteller-controlled NPCs.

    Social Mobility
    </div>
  The Free State is a turbulent place, with Kindred gangs roaming the streets looking for each and every chance to grab a piece for their own. With our custom background <a href="#backgrounds#territory"><b>Territory</b></a>, you can start making an name for yourself, provided you have the following to do so.

    Sect Coherency
    </div>
  The only allegiance allowed in play are to the Camarilla, Anarch Movement, and any Independent organization (Giovanni, Setite Cults, etc). Characters can have been active in the Sabbat in the past, but in order to be approved must no longer be aligned with them.
