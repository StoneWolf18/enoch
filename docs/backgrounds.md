Unlike Attributes and Abilities, Backgrounds are the mechanical representation of all the external things a character has: relationships, material wealth, social status, and so on. Because of this, there has to be a rational reason as to why they came to have them. Who are they pretending to be with an alternate identity? What made them famous among a certain circle of people? If your character concept is fleshed out enough, these shouldn't be hard to come up with.

Of course, <b>Generation</b> isn't exactly bound by these rules. While Kindred of higher generations are generally younger and vice versa, that doesn't always have to be the case. You would, however, still have to explain why a couple centuries old 7th gen vampire would embrace a 20-something in the modern nights.

<b>Important</b>

* Influence has a 2 dot maximum.
* Anything above 3 dots will require approval from the Storyteller or an Assistant
* Havens are included under resources, not domain
* Domain is territory officially recognized by the Baron of that location, which is unlikely to be had at character creation.

<div class="secondHeader" id="allies">Allies</div>
Allies are mortals who support and help you — family, friends, or even a mortal organization that owes you some loyalty. Although allies aid you willingly, without coaxing or coercion, they are not always available to offer assistance; they have their own concerns and can do only so much for the sake of your relationship. However, they might have some useful Background Traits of their own, and could provide you with indirect access to their contacts, influence, or resources.

Allies are typically persons of influence and power in your home city. They can be of almost any sort, depending on what your Storyteller will allow. You may have friends in the precinct morgue, at a prominent blog, among the high society of local celebrities, or at a construction site. Your Allies might be a clan of nomads who move their mobile home camp around the area, or they might be a family of generations of police officers. You may even count the mayor himself among your friends, depending on how many dots you spend on this Trait. Your Allies are generally trustworthy (though they probably don’t know that you’re a vampire, or even that vampires exist). However, nothing comes for free. If you wind up drawing favors from your friend in the Cosa Nostra, he’ll probably ask you to do him a favor in kind in the future. This often leads to the beginning of a story.…

<em>Allies must be listed on a character sheet with their name and relation to the character.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> One ally of moderate influence and power <br>

<div class="secondHeader" id="alternate-identity">Alternate Identity</div>
You maintain an alternate identity, complete with papers, birth certificates, or any other documentation you desire. Only a few may know your real name or identity. Your alternate persona may be highly involved in organized crime, a member of the opposite Sect, a con artist who uses alternate identities for her game, or you may simply gather information about the enemy. Indeed, some vampires may know you as one individual while others believe you to be someone else entirely.

<em>This must be justified within the character's backstory and be roleplayed at the appropriate dot level.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> You are new at this identity game. Sometimes you slip and forget your other persona. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> You are well grounded in your alternate identity. You are convincing enough to play the part of a doctor, lawyer, funeral salesman, drug-smuggler, or a capable spy. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> You have a fair reputation as your alternate persona and get name-recognition in the area where you have infiltrated. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Your alternate identity has respect and trust within your area of infiltration. <br>

You have the trust (or at least the recognition) of many powerful individuals within your area.

<div class="secondHeader" id="contacts">Contacts</div>
You know people all over the city. When you start making phone calls around your network, the amount of information you can dig up is impressive. Rather than friends you can rely on to help you, like Allies, Contacts are largely people whom you can bribe, manipulate, or coerce into offering information. You also have a few major Contacts — associates who can give you accurate information in their fields of expertise. You should describe each major contact in some detail before the game begins.

In addition to your major contacts, you also have a number of minor contacts spread throughout the city. Your major contact might be in the district attorney’s office, while your minor contacts might include beat cops, DMV clerks, club bouncers, or members of an online social network. You don’t need to detail these various “passing acquaintances” before play. Instead, to successfully get in touch with a minor contact, you should roll your Contacts rating (difficulty 7). You can reach one minor contact for each success. Of course, you still have to convince them to give you the information you need, assuming they can get it.

<em>Contacts must be listed on a character sheet with their name and relation to the character, as well as fleshed out in the character's backstory as to why they're a contact in the first place.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> One major contact <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Two major contacts <br>

<div class="secondHeader" id="domain">Domain</div>
Domain is physical territory (usually within the chronicle’s central city) to which your character controls access for the purpose of feeding. Some Kindred refer to their domain as hunting grounds, and most jealously guard their domains, even invoking the Tradition of the same name to protect their claims. As part of this Background, the character’s claim to the domain is recognized by the Prince or some other Kindred authority in the city where it is located.

The Kindred who claims the domain can’t keep the living inhabitants from going about their business, nor does she exercise any direct influence over them, but she can keep watch herself and mind their comings and goings. She can also have Allies or Retainers specifically look for unfamiliar vampires and alert her when they find some.

Domain refers specifically to the geography (in most cases a neighborhood or street) and properties on it, as opposed to the people who may dwell there (which is the emphasis of Herd). Domain plays an important part in Kindred society — vampires who lack significant Domain seldom earn respect — but it isn’t an automatic entitlement to status among the Damned.

You may designate one or more dots in Domain to increase the security of your character’s territory rather than its size. Each dot so assigned to security provides a +1 difficulty penalty to efforts to intrude into the domain by anyone your character hasn’t specifically allowed in, and a -1 difficulty bonus to efforts by your character to identify and track intruders in the domain. A Domain of one dot’s size and two dots’ security, for instance, is small but quite resistant to intrusion, as opposed to a Domain rating of three dots’ size with no extraordinary security.

<em>Domain is a piece of territory officially granted by the Baron of that location. A PC is unlikely to have this at character creation.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> A single small building, such as a single-family home or a social establishment — enough for a basic haven. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> A church, factory, warehouse, mid-rise, or other large structure — a location with ready but easily controllable access to the outside world. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> A high-rise, city block, or an important intersection — a location or area that offers areas for concealment as well as controlled access. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> A sewer subsection, a network of service tunnels, the enclave of homes on a hill overlooking the city — a place with inherently protective features, such as an isolated mountain road, bridge-only access, or vigilant private security force. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> An entire neighborhood, an ethnic subdivision like “Chinatown” or “Little Italy,” or a whole suburb.

<div class="secondHeader" id="fame">Fame</div>
You enjoy widespread recognition in mortal society, perhaps as an entertainer, writer, or athlete. People may enjoy just being seen with you. This gives you all manner of privileges when moving in mortal society, but can also attract an unwanted amount of attention now that you’re no longer alive. The greatest weapon fame has to offer is the ability to sway public opinion — as modern media constantly proves. Fame isn’t always tied to entertainment: A heinous criminal in a high-profile trial probably has a certain amount of fame, as do a lawmaker and a scientist who has made a popularized discovery.

<em>Remember that fame is a double edged sword, and is easily something that could shatter the Masquerade if high enough.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> You’re known to a select subculture — local club-goers, industry bloggers, or the Park Avenue set, for instance. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Random people start to recognize your face; you’re a minor celebrity such as a small-time criminal or a local news anchor. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> You have greater renown; perhaps you’re a senator or an entertainer who regularly gets hundreds of thousands of YouTube hits. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> A full-blown celebrity; your name is often recognized by the average person on the street. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> You’re a household word. People name their children after you.

<div class="secondHeader" id="generation">Generation</div>
This Background represents your Generation: the purity of your blood, and your proximity to the First Vampire. A high Generation rating may represent a powerful sire or a decidedly dangerous taste for diablerie. If you don’t take any dots in this Trait, you begin play as a Thirteenth Generation vampire. See p. 270 for further information.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Twelfth Generation: 11 blood pool, can spend 1 blood point per turn <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Twelfth Generation: 11 blood pool, can spend 1 blood point per turn <br>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Ninth Generation: 14 blood pool, can spend 2 blood points per turn <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Eighth Generation: 15 blood pool, can spend 3 blood points per turn

<div class="secondHeader" id="herd">Herd</div>
You have built a group of mortals from whom you can feed without fear. A herd may take many forms, from circles of kinky clubgoers to actual cults built around you as a god-figure. In addition to providing nourishment, your herd might come in handy for minor tasks, though they are typically not very controllable, closely connected to you, or particularly skilled (for more effective pawns, purchase Allies or Retainers). Your Herd rating adds dice to your rolls for hunting; see p. 259 for further details.

<em>The nature of their herd must align with a character's traits. A anti-social character is unlikely to have a herd made of clubgoers.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Three vessels <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Seven vessels <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> 15 vessels <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> 30 vessels <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> 60 vessels

<div class="secondHeader" id="influence">Influence</div>
You have pull in the mortal community, whether through wealth, prestige, political office, blackmail, or supernatural manipulation. Kindred with high Influence can sway, and in rare cases even control, the political and social processes of human society. Influence represents the sum of your opinion or policy-swaying power in your community, particularly among the police and bureaucracy. In some cases, cultivating Influence is a path to generating Resources (see below).

Some rolls may require you to use Influence in place of an Ability, particularly when attempting to sway minor bureaucrats. It’s easier to institute sweeping changes on a local level than a worldwide scale (e.g., having an “abandoned” building demolished is relatively easy, while starting a war is a bit more difficult).

<em>While a single dot of influence can be attributed to family prestige, further dots will requie the character to have earned it themselves.</em>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Moderately influential; a factor in city politics <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Well-connected; a force in state politics <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Position of influence; a factor in regional politics <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> Broad personal power; a force in national politics <br>
