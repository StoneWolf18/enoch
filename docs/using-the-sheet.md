The constant paper-shuffle of dealing with PDFs gets to be a hassle, which is why we only accept the google docs character sheets found below:

* <a href="http://bit.ly/Vampire-Sheet-2021">Vampire</a>
* <a href="http://bit.ly/Ghoul-Sheet-2021">Ghoul</a>
* <a href="http://bit.ly/human-sheet-2021">Human</a>

<div class="leftHeader">Creating the Sheet</div>

After opening the link and making sure you're signed into a google account, go to File > make a copy, and save it somewhere into your drive.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Important</b>

Don't open the sheet in Microsoft Word. The formatting won't transfer, and the whole thing will break.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">The key</span> is to indicate how you got certain dots at a glance.

* <b>Base dots should remain black.</b> They're the dots you distribute though character creation (such as the 7/5/3 attribute dots).
* <span style="color: orange;">Free</span> dots are any dots given by the Storyteller without requiring a cost
* <span style="color: #4a86e8">Freebies</span> mean any dots bought with freebies
* <span style="color: red;">Experience</span> are any dots bought with experience
* <span style ="color:#9900ff;">Earned</span> are any dots earned in character. Normally, this will only apply to backgrounds, as they can't be purchased with experience directly.

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">The header</span> is where all the basic information tied to a character goes. The grid is made from a table. Text can be entered to the right of the label in the same box.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Important</b>

When you first open the sheet, it'll have a dot (x) in every ability. <b>This is only to show where they go.</b> Remove them before filling the sheet out.

</div>

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Trait ratings/dots</span> are marked with an x in the space to the right of the line.

<span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Specialties</span> are recorded on the line in between the trait's name and dot rating, much like on the traditional Vampire character sheet.

<span style="color: #8000FF; font-weight: bold;">Advantage Labels</span> are the name of disciplines/backgrounds respectively. There will be an example on the top line indication where it goes, but that can be removed if desired.

<span style="color: #FF0080; font-weight: bold;">Advantage Dots</span> are the dots of the disciplines/backgrounds. Along with the labels, the example indicating where they go can be removed.

<span style="color: #00FF40; font-weight: bold;">Humanity/Willpower Tracks</span> should have the base values should be recorded in grey. Anything bought with freebies or xp should be marked according to the key (such as the two willpower bought with freebies.)

<img src="assets/sheetCharts.png">

<span style="color: #00FFFF; font-weight: bold;">Chart Label</span> are the names for merits/flaws, freebie buys, and experience purchases.

<span style="color: #FFFF00; font-weight: bold;">Chart Values</span> are the cost/bonus for merits/flaws, freebie buys, and experience purchases.
