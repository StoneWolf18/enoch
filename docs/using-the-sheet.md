      Using the Character Sheet

<div class="container">

The constant paper-shuffle of dealing with PDFs gets to be a hassle, which is why we only accept the google docs character sheets found below:

* <a href="http://bit.ly/Vampire-Sheet-2021">Vampire</a>
* <a href="http://bit.ly/Ghoul-Sheet-2021">Ghoul</a>
* <a href="http://bit.ly/human-sheet-2021">Human</a>

<div class="leftHeader">Creating the Sheet</div>

After opening the link and making sure you're signed into a google account, go to File > make a copy, and save it somewhere into your drive.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Important</b>

Don't open the sheet in Microsoft Word. The formatting won't transfer, and the whole thing will break.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">The key</span> is to indicate how you got certain dots at a glance.

* <b>Base dots should remain black.</b> They're the dots you distribute though character creation (such as the 7/5/3 attribute dots).
* <span style="color: orange;">Free</span> dots are any dots given by the Storyteller without requiring a cost
* <span style="color: #4a86e8">Freebies</span> mean any dots bought with freebies
* <span style="color: red;">Experience</span> are any dots bought with experience
* <span style ="color:#9900ff;">Earned</span> are any dots earned in character. Normally, this will only apply to backgrounds, as they can't be purchased with experience directly.

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">The header</span> is where all the basic information tied to a character goes. The grid is made from a table. Text can be entered to the right of the label in the same box.

<img src="assets/sheetTraits.png">

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Trait ratings/dots</span> are marked with an x in the space to the right of the line.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Important</b>

When you first open the sheet, it'll have a dot (x) in every ability. <b>This is only to show where they go.</b> Remove them before filling the sheet out.

</div>

<span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Specialites</span> are recorded on the line in between the trait's name and dot rating, much like on the traditional Vampire character sheet.
