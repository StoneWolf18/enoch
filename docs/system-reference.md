<div class="leftHeader" id="blood-bonds">Blood Bonds</div>
We treat blood bonds a little differently than described in the V20 core or Ghouls and Revenants to give those who want to play ghouls a little more autonomy. As long as each drink is at least a month apart, the blood bond level <b>will not increase</b>. Meaning: if you play a ghoul, they can remain bound at the first level indefinitely unless points of vitae are taken from their domitor before that month is up. To increase a bond's level, each point of vitae still must be drank on different nights.

<div class="secondHeader" id="bond-levels">Bond Levels</div>
Below is a rough summary of what each level is like. It's recommended you read the full descriptions starting on page 286 of the core to get a full idea of what each step means.

* <b>First Step:</b> Amplifies whatever feelings were already present for the regnant, whether positive or negative.
* <b>Second Step:</b> Heavily biased towards the regnant, but still has full control over themselves.
* <b>Third Step:</b> A full bond; Completely infatuated with the regnant, they take priority over anyone else in their life, whether they were a lover, child, or close friend.

<div class="leftHeader" id="frenzy-resist">Frenzy Resist</div>
Frenzies are resisted with Self-Control unless the character is on an Instinct path. Characters with Instinct will <b>always</b> frenzy if the difficulty to resist is less than her Instinct rating.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Important</b>

The charts below are a generalized example. A Storyteller can alter these difficulties if they feel the situation is more/less severe.

Degeneration must be rolled when committing an act equal to or below your character's current Humanity rating.

<div class="yourAttentionPlease">

<b>Wait, why is property damage below draining someone?</b>

Intent. Going into a hunger frenzy because you were completely out of vitae and killing someone without meaning to doesn't have the same intent behind it as purposefully committing arson. One was an action driven the Beast, the other was entirely you.

<div class="leftHeader" id="multiple-actions">Multiple Actions</div>
You can take more than one action during a turn, however, multi-tasking is never as effective. You must use the lowest pool out of the rolls you're intending to make, and divide it up between however many actions you're taking.

For example: you want to both stab at the thug in front of you and fire a pistol at his friend behind him. If your Dexterity + Melee pool is 7, but your Dexterity + Firearms pool is 6, you would have to use your Dexterity + Firearms pool. You then have 6 dice to split between these two actions as you see fit: 3 and 3, 2 and 4, etc.

<div class="leftHeader" id="vitae-withdrawl">Vitae Withdrawl</div>
Symptoms of withdrawl begin as soon as the ghoul hasn't had their monthly feeding, and lasts for 6 - Stamina weeks. The actual withdrawl symptoms themselves vary, and depend on how long the ghoul's been feeding on vitae. This can include, but isn't limited to: seizures, fever, nightmares, and disorientation.

When exposed to vitae while undergoing a withdrawl, the ghoul will have to make a Self-Control roll versus 7 in order to resist feeding again.

<em>* As a general rule, a ghoul attains a cost break to learn the Disciplines of their sponsor's Clan. A Revenant, on the other hand, earns a cost break on their family's Disciplines. <br>
**It is much more difficult for independent Ghouls to learn Disciplines than any other Ghoul or Revenant, and this is reflected in the cost required.<br>
