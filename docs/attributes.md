      Attributes
  </div>
</div>

<div class = "container">
All characters in the World of Darkness have attributes: 9 different traits that everyone has to some degree, living or dead. While most people will have ratings from 1 (below average) to 2 (average) or 3 (above average), someone highly trained or gifted might have ratings of 4 (exceptionally good) or even 5 (peak human capacity.)

Vampires, not being human, might break this mundane mold. The Nosferatu have an appearance rating of 0 for their hideous clan weakness, whereas particularly old Kindred might have ratings that surpass what humans are capable of (6+).

<div class = "leftHeader">Specialties</div>

Not everyone is good at the same things in the same way. A skilled marksman might be proficient with rifles while another pistols. An academic might have studied European history while someone else focused on linguistics. To portray this, all characters with ratings of 4 or higher in either Attributes or Abilities can choose Specialties for those traits.

A specialty is a specific subcategory of the Attribute or Ability. Someone with a dexterity rating of 4 might be good at sprinting, while a character with Crafts 5 might be an impressive painter. Whenever a roll is made, and the action would fall under the chosen specialty, any die that rolls a 10 is counted as 2 successes rather than 1.

All of the specialties listed below are examples, others can be made up so long as they aren't too broad.

<div class="leftHeader">Physical</div>
<em>Physical Attributes summarize the condition of the character's body. They represent how strong, agile, and resilient they are. Physical Attributes should be taken as the primary category for an action-oriented character.</em>

<em>Vampires may use ingested blood to supernaturally augment their Physical (and only their Physical) Attributes. For more on this, see p. 268.</em>

<div class="secondHeader">Strength</div>
Strength is the raw, brute power of a character. It governs how much weight a character can lift, how much he can physically push, and how hard he can hit another character or object. The Strength Trait is added to a character’s damage dice pool when he hits his opponent in hand-to-hand combat. It is also used when a character wishes to break, lift, or carry something, as well as when a character tries to jump a distance.

<div class="secondHeader">Dexterity</div>
The Dexterity Attribute measures a character’s general physical prowess. It encompasses the character’s speed, agility, and overall quickness, as well as indicating the character’s ability to manipulate objects with control and precision. Also included under Dexterity’s heading are hand-eye coordination, reflexes, and bodily grace.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> You are clumsy and awkward. Put that gun down before you hurt yourself. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> You’re no clod, but you’re no ballerina, either. <br>

<div class="secondHeader">Stamina</div>
The Stamina Trait reflects a character’s health, toughness, and resilience. It indicates how long a character can exert herself and how much punishment she can withstand before suffering physical trauma. Stamina also includes a bit of psychic fortitude, indicating a character’s grit and tenacity.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> You bruise in a stiff wind. <br>

<b>Specialties:</b> Aggressive, dedicated, determined, durable, enduring, forceful, formidable, hardy constitution, hell-bent, high-pain threshold, resilient, relentless, robust, stalwart, steadfast, stubborn, sturdy, tenacious, tireless, tough, unmovable, unyielding

<div class="leftHeader">Social</div>
<em>Despite their often lonely fates, Kindred use human society like building blocks to advance their schemes. Social Attributes delineate a character’s appearance, charm, and ability to interact with society. These Traits are paramount in determining a character’s first impressions, personal dynamics, and relations with other individuals.</em>

<div class="secondHeader">Charisma</div>
Charisma is a character’s ability to entice and please others through her personality. Charisma comes into question when a character tries to win another character’s sympathies or encourage others to trust her. Charisma reflects the power of a character’s charm and influence. It governs a character’s ability to convince others to see her point of view. This Attribute doesn’t necessarily indicate how the character is charismatic, whether she’s a silver-tongued charmer or a grinning bully. (These should come across through roleplaying and specialties.)

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> There’s something a little sketchy about you. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> You are generally likable and have several friends. <br>

<b>Specialties:</b> Amusing, captivating, charming, classy, commanding, compelling, confidant, congenial, cultured, diplomatic, eloquent, folksy, genial, gracious, gregarious, inspiring, irresistible, magnetic, outgoing, pleasant, regal, rustic, savoir-faire, sensual, smooth, sophisticated, sweet, trustworthy, urbane, well-mannered, winsome

<div class="secondHeader">Manipulation</div>
Manipulation measures a character’s ability for self expression in the interests of getting others to share her outlook or follow her whims. In short, it’s getting others to do what she wants. Manipulation comes into play when a character tries to influence or subtly guide another’s behavior. Manipulation is used to trick, bluff, fast-talk, and railroad other characters. Whether or not the characters in question actually like the manipulator is irrelevant (this is why Manipulation differs from Charisma). After all, a skilled motivator can even employ the talents of people who hate her.

Manipulation is a dangerous affair, though it is way many Kindred primarily affect the world around them. Failed attempts at manipulation often earn the ire of the would-be patsy. Botching a Manipulation roll may add a name to the character’s list of enemies.

People are manipulated every day, and typically ignore it. (“Would you run to the store for me?”) If the fact is brought to their attention, however, many people become quite defensive. Manipulation can be the most powerful tool in a Kindred’s repertoire, but failure can be disastrous. Characters with high Manipulation ratings are often distrusted by those around them.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> A person of few (often ineffectual) words. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> You can fool some of the people some of the time, just like anybody else. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Good:</b> You never pay full price. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Exceptional:</b> You could be a politician or cult leader. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Outstanding:</b> “Of course I’ll tell the Prince I was the one who tried to stake him!”

<b>Specialties:</b> Blarney, bravado, calculating, charming, conspiratorial, controlling, crafty, cunning, deceitful, devious, double-talker, eloquent, expressive, forked tongue, glib, influential, ingratiating, legalese, logical, Machiavellian, maneuvering, patient, persuasive, remorseless, resourceful, scheming, silver-tongued, slick, sly, smooth, sophist, subtle, tactful, underhanded, witty

<div class="secondHeader">Appearance</div>
The Appearance Attribute is a measure of how well a character makes a first impression. This may be conventional “attractiveness,” but it can also be the effect of distinctive features, an exotic mien, an air of confidence, distinctive posture, a flair for dressing well — anything remarkable upon initial observation can contribute to a character’s Appearance. Indeed, Appearance is the amalgamation of many descriptive personal characteristics. Appearance is subconscious and instinctual — it appeals to the lower levels of the psyche, so it shapes first impressions and the nature of memories thereafter.

This Trait is useful for getting potential vessels to situations in which first impressions are paramount, or that involve people who view Appearance as very important, a character may have no more dice in a Social dice pool than her Appearance rating. Thus, it is critically important to either look your best or get to know people before you start trying to convince them to firebomb the Justicar’s haven.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> Your clothes stink, you turn people off right away, or you’re just damned ugly. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> You don’t stand out in a crowd, for better or for worse. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Good:</b> “Let me buy you a drink.” <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Exceptional:</b> People go out of their way to make your acquaintance. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Outstanding:</b> People never forget you.

<b>Specialties:</b> Alluring, beautiful, bold demeanor, captivating, comely, cuddly, curvaceous, cute, delightful, dignified, exotic, fragility, glamorous, gorgeous, handsome, honest face, hot, imposing, innocent, inspiring, look of the eagles, luminous, noble, pleasing, pretty, provocative, roguish, seductive, sensual, sexy, shapely, slinky, striking, stunning, stylish, wild

<div class="leftHeader">Mental</div>
<em>Mental Attributes define a character’s epistemic capacities, including such aspects as memory, intelligence, awareness of one’s surroundings, and the ability to think, learn, and react.</em>

<div class="secondHeader">Perception</div>
Perception measures a character’s ability to observe his environment. This may involve a conscious effort, such as searching an area, but it is more often intuitive, as the character’s keen senses notice something out of the ordinary. Perception is a sensitivity to one’s surroundings, and is seldom present in the cynical or jaded (who have seen it all before).

Perception is used to determine whether or not a character understands a given situation or detects an environmental stimulus. It can warn a character of ambushes,
distinguish a clue from a pile of refuse, or uncover any other hidden or overlookable detail, whether physical or otherwise.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> Perhaps you are absurdly self-absorbed, perhaps merely an airhead. In any event, watch out for that car! <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> The very subtle evades you, but you’re aware of the bigger picture. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Good:</b> You perceive moods, textures, and small changes in your environment. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Exceptional:</b> Almost nothing escapes your notice. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Outstanding:</b> You instantly observe things almost imperceptible to human senses.

<b>Specialties:</b> Apprehensive, astute, attentive, canny, clueful, detail-oriented, discerning, empathic, feral, insightful, instinctive, intuitive, keen-eyed, observant, paranoid, patient, probing, sensitive, sharp hearing, vigilant, visionary, wary, watchful

<div class="secondHeader">Intelligence</div>
The Intelligence Attribute refers to a character’s grasp of facts and knowledge. It also governs a character’s ability to reason, solve problems, and evaluate situations. Intelligence also includes critical thinking and flexibility of thought.

Intelligence does not include savvy, wisdom, or common sense, as those are properties of the character’s personality, not Traits. Even the smartest character may be too foolish to realize the thugs who want to “borrow” her car keys are up to no good.

Characters with low Intelligence aren’t necessarily stupid (though they might be); they are just uneducated or simple thinkers. Likewise, characters with high Intelligence aren’t all Einsteins; they may be better at rote memorization or have particularly keen judgment.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> Not the sharpest knife in the drawer. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> Smart enough to realize you’re normal. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Good:</b> More enlightened than the masses. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Exceptional:</b> You’re not just bright, you’re downright brilliant. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Outstanding:</b> Certified genius.

<b>Specialties:</b> Analytical, astute, bookworm, brilliant, calculating, clear thinker, cognitive, creative, discerning, discriminating, erudite, genius, innovative, inventive, knowledgeable, logical, plotting, pragmatic, rational, researcher, resourceful, sagacious, savvy, scheming, scholarly, scientific, sharp memory

<div class="secondHeader">Wits</div>
The Wits Trait measures the character’s ability to think on her feet and react quickly to a certain situation. It also reflects a character’s general cleverness. Characters with low Wits ratings are thick and mentally lethargic, or maybe gullible and unsophisticated. By contrast, characters with high Wits Traits almost always have a plan immediately and adapt to their surroundings with striking expedience. Characters with high Wits also manage to keep their cool in stressful situations.

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Poor:</b> Pull my finger. <br>
<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Average:</b> You know when to bet or fold in poker. <br>

<i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i><i class="fas fa-circle fa-sm"></i> <b>Outstanding:</b> You think and respond almost more quickly than you can act.

<b>Specialties:</b> Apt, calculating, clear-headed, clever, combat nerves, creative, direct, extemporaneous, flexible, free association, impulsive, instinctive, insults, jumpy, levelheaded, one step ahead, practical, quick, reactive, resourceful, sharp, shrewd, skillful, spontaneous, survival, wily
